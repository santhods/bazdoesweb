# Baramee's Personal Site

## Hello, Welcome to my personal site, it is full of mess!
My name is Baramee, or Baz for short. I am a developer (professionally in a junior level) but have been coding since the age of 15. My passsion in computing and software development is all over the place - depending on what's interesting...

Web, Desktop, Linux Kernel, Mobile, Cloud, WordPress. Currently settling down on a low-code platform [Microsoft Power Platform :)].
